# CV_base
## 1.Introduction (2)
### Introduction to computer vision
The goal of computer vision:
- To bridge the gap between pixels and “meaning”

### Linear algebra primer
#### Vectors and matrices
Basic Matrix Operations
Special Matrices
#### Transformation Matrices
Homogeneous coordinates
Translation
#### Matrix inverse
#### Matrix rank
#### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Use for image compression
Use for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Computer algorithm

## 2.Pixels and Features (2.5)
### Pixels and filters 
Images as functions 

Linear systems (filters) 

Convolution and correlation

### Edge detection 
### Feature point extraction - SIFT 
## 3.Regions of Images and Segmentation (1.5)
### Clustering -  K-means and mean shift
